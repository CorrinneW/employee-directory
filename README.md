# React Employee Directory
Single-page React app using randomuser generator => https://randomuser.me/

## The Goal
Build a single-page React app which allows users to search and sort employee profiles by name, as well as filter by location.

## What I Did
1. Used create-react-app to build an initial file structure
2. Built pages, as well as class and function based components using JSX
3. Used Bootstrap and Material UI for styling
4. Wrote functions to set and alter state, and used prop drilling to make those functions accessible to child components
5. Deployed using gh-pages
